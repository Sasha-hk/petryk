# Oleksandr Petryk's website

Hi, I wrote this website for myself as CV and pet project.

The technologies I use to create the site:

- TypeScript (programming language)
- React.js (UI framework)
- Next.js (for SSR)
- TailwindCSS (CSS framework)
- PostCSS (preprocessor)
- Yarn (package manager)
- Docker (container)
- Nginx (web server)
- VPS (server)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- GitHub Packages (Docker images hosting)

Development environment:

- ESLint (JS / TS code analyzer)
- MarkDownLint (MD analyzer)
- EditorConfig (consistent coding styles)
- CommitLint (lint commit messages)
- Husky (git hooks)
- DependaBot (dependencies updater)
- HadoLint (Docker linter)
- other VS Code extensions

## Run in development mode

Requirements to run:

- Node.js v16
- Package manager Yarn

Run process:

1. At the root of the project run the following:

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

2. Run Next.js in development mode:

   ```sh

   ```
